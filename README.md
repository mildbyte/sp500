# You're probably not going to get rich in the stock market
Code and data used to produce charts analyzing the SP500 returns for my [blog post](https://kimonote.com/@mildbyte/youre-probably-not-going-to-get-rich-in-the-stock-market-35569/).

The SP500 price and dividend data as well as the CPI values were taken from [Robert Shiller's website](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm). I exported his spreadsheet into CSV. The SP500 total return index I used to make sure my constructed index matched was taken from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR).

There's a chance the environment.yml file contains everything needed to run the notebook with Anaconda. Otherwise, you can use the GitHub's non-interactive viewer [here](https://github.com/mildbyte/sp500/blob/master/Simulating%20various%20SP500%20investment%20strategies.ipynb).
